# On-Chain Leaderboard

## 📌 Project Title
**On-Chain Leaderboard**

---

## 📄 Project Description
The On-Chain Leaderboard is a Soroban smart contract that allows users to submit and view player scores directly on the blockchain. It supports individual score tracking and provides a basic leaderboard structure that can be extended for competitive gaming, educational rankings, or gamified applications.

## 🎯 Project Vision
The vision behind the On-Chain Leaderboard is to decentralize scoreboards by storing them transparently and securely on-chain. This ensures tamper-proof player data and opens up possibilities for trustless tournaments, prize mechanisms, and community challenges without relying on centralized databases.
